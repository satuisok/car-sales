Work in Process. Car Sales Data Parser from XML to mySQL Database

This project is a JavaScript and Node.js based solution that parses car sales data from XML files into a MySQL database. This project is still work in process.
The parsed data can be used to analyze trends, make predictions and improve decision making in the automotive industry.

How it works:
The parser uses the xml2js library to convert the XML data into a JavaScript object. The parsed data is then inserted into a MySQL database using the mysql2 package.

Features:   
1) Parses car sales data from XML files
2) Inserts parsed data into a MySQL database.
3) Deletes data from the database if data is also removed from the XML file.
